# C# Console Games

This repository contains source code of some C# console games - Cars, Ping Pong, Snake, Tetris and Tic-Tac-Toe.

All of them are inspired by the videos of **Nikolay Kostov** as I modified the games a little bit and refactored the source code of Cars, Ping Pong and Snake games with OOP. Here is the **link** of his repository as well as his **video explanations in Bulgarian**:
